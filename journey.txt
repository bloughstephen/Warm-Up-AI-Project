This details my Journey through Jaseci:

Setup to install python 3.10 took some time but it all worked out. After that Part 1 went along easily. With part 2, I didn't have any issues with running anything. I did realize that I need to relaunch the command line after downloading the AI toolkit because it wouldn't recognize it if I stayed within the same session while downloading it.

For part 3, I had some issues with getting the model to successfully train but once I got that done the rest went by pretty well.
